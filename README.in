Install
=======

You will need an ANSI C compiler (like gcc or egcs) to compile
this package.

Just type `make', followed by `make install'.

History
=======

The main difference with version 1.0 by Paul Vixie is that this
version will not return directory names as being executables
and that by default it will expand a leading "./" and "~/" to
its full path on output.
