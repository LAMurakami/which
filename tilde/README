This directory was copied from bash-2.03.

I then added the files Makefile.am and generated Makefile.in from it.

The original README reads:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're building this separately from bash or the readline library, add
$(srcdir)/shell.c to the CSOURCES variable and shell.o to the OBJECTS
variable in Makefile.in.  (Not that this is very useful without readline
or bash.)
