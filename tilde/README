This directory was copied from bash-2.03.

I then added the files Makefile.am, configure.in, acinclude.m4 and and
acconfig.h and generated all the files that are generated from those ;).

The original README reads:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're building this separately from bash or the readline library, add
$(srcdir)/shell.c to the CSOURCES variable and shell.o to the OBJECTS
variable in Makefile.in.  (Not that this is very useful without readline
or bash.)
