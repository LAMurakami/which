takes one or more arguments.  For each of its arguments it
prints to stdout the full path of the executables that would have

It does this by searching for an executable or script in the
directories listed in the environment variable
.B PATH
using the same algorithm as bash(1).

.B PATH

then print "./programname" rather than the full path.
